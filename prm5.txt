ALGORITHM: 
START 
Step 1:[Input value of degree] 
Read degree 
Step 2:[Input value of limit] 
Read n 
Step 3: [Convert degree to radians] 
X=(degree *PI)/180 
Step 4: [InitialCSE] 
term =x 
sum=term 
Step 5: [Calcuate each term and add] 
term=-term*x*x/((i-1)*i); 
sum=sum+term; 
Step 6: [Print the output] 
Print the sine value for the given degree

 A sensor in a robotic arm needs to calculate the angle of rotation in real-time, but the 
hardware doesn't support built-in trigonometric functions. Develop a C program to 
approximate the value of sin(x) using a series expansion method for improved performance.
